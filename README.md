## What is the structure of your engineering team? What engineering processes do you employ?

We're in that small scrappy startup mode. We're flat from an engineering and product perspective. Our team is small (3 engineers and 1 product person) so you're going to want to like to own a lot of things from start to finish. We deal in features; architecture and clean code are important to us and you'll be glad to know we sit in chairs, not ivory towers. You're empowered from the start to make immediate and meaningful contributions to the product.

We also work hand in hand with our Product lead when it comes to building things. At Parallel, the engineers are engaged from the start; we spend around 10-15% of the time hashing out and understanding the work in a refinement process. You're not waiting for your boss to hand you work ya know?

Our process is a standard Scrum. Not a ton of bells and whistles. We time-box work and release immediately. Our team makes heavy use of feature flags in order to get code out quickly. We utilize jest and are open to new testing techniques.

Organizationally, not just in engineering, we use metrics in order to understand how we are working and where we can work more efficiently. We track things like Time to Merge, Time to Close Bugs and other metrics that give us assurance that process and team are in top shape. This is not a bad thing; this is how we feel safe. It lets us feel good when we take a break!

Lastly, empathy is part of the process. We track and encourage improvements in how we collaborate and communicate. It's a remote-first company. We're interested in creating an environment that feels like a craftsperson's workshop! Social, productive, funky and fun.


## What are some interesting technical challenges you deal with?


It's not all standard "web-work". We're flexible in the tools that we employ; but telehealth/WebRTC brings up some questions. How do you test video? How do you track who's in where? How do you allow for security yet easily let people join therapy appointments?

Your work has immediate impact on the lives of kids, teens and seasoned therapy providers. You're going to think about your customers in a different way.

We also favor a lean architecture. There isn't a ton of huge big-metal, on-premise work here; We get along quite easily with Google Cloud and batteries included tech when appropriate.  The team will challenge you to keep solutions lean, mighty and nimble!
